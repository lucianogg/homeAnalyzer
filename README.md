# Home Analyzer
The objective here is to create a set of small programs to store and then interpret data collected by me and some machines at home. The main purpose is to keep learning Python and review the contents of a Machine Learning course.

## Time estimated to start being something interesting:
At least 2 months to gather sufficient data (60 nights more or less)
